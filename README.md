# Bbin

Bbin is an experimental binary installer. It's like pip but it installs generic binaries.

So it's kind of like [Homebrew][homebrew], except that it doesn't installs to `/usr/local/bin/` by default and it *always* builds from source.

## Installation

I haven't uploaded this to PyPi yet since this is **super experimental**. But, if you want, here's how you can install.

First, get [Poetry][poetry]. It's the package manager this project uses (and it's easy to [install Poetry][1]). Second, [clone this repo][ctr]. And third, **add the `bbin` directory to your `$PYTHONPATH`**.

## Usage

Let's say we wanted to install a package named `hello_world`. Then we would simply do

```sh
$ python3 -m bbin install hello_world
üç∞‚ú®
```

Other commands can be found via `bbin --help`

## Uninstall

Well, there's the `~/.config/bbin` directory that it creates, the `~/bin` directory for storing installed binaries, and the `~/app` directory for graphical apps (WIP!).
